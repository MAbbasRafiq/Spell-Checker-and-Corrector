"Isn't that amusing?" asked John, grinning widely.At the same time, a group of children were playing in the puddles, splashing water everywhere. Their shoes and socks were soaked, yet they continued without a worry.One of them, a boy named Charlie, shouted, "Let’s race to the playground!" They all agreed happily and started tuning toward the swings.Meanwhile, an old man sited on a benchmark reading a newspaper. He didn’t seem bothered by the noise or the damp air.Suddenly, a loud thunder clap startled everyone, but only for a moment. The rain slowed, then stopped, leaving behind a soft, misty breeze.What a beautiful scene it was, full of joy, life, and little imperfections that made it feel just right.
